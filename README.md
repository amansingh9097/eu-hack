## How can I benefit from TED?
TED provides free access to business opportunities from the European Union, the European Economic Area and beyond.

Every day, from Monday to Friday about 2,400 public procurement notices are published on TED.

You can browse, search and sort procurement notices by country, region, business sector and more.

Information about every procurement document is published in the 24 official EU languages. All notices from the EU's institutions are published in full in these languages.

## How does this repository help?
A subset of [Tenders Electronic Daily (TED)](https://europa.eu/european-union/index_en) data covering public procurement for the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the Republic of North Macedonia from 2006-01-01 to 2019-12-31 in comma separated value format from the [EU Open Data Portal](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/ted-csv), but there is always a  year's lag between what's available as comma separated file vs XML files available on their [FTP address](ftp://ted.europa.eu/).

Hence, using these parser to gain early access to those public procurements will give you an upper hand in the competitive marketspace of Sustainable Global Development for European Union donors.
