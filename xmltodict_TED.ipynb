Some examples of when it may not be considered appropriate by the Contracting Authority are when the tender rely in majority on the capacities of other entities or when they rely on key criteria. If the tender relies on other entities it must prove to the Contracting Authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for performance of the contract, for example by producing a commitment on the part of those entities to place those resources at its disposal. Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality – and must comply with the selection criteria for which the economic operator relies on them. Furthermore, the data for this third entity for the relevant selection criterion should be included in the tender in a separate document. Proof of the capacity will also have to be furnished when requested by the Contracting Authority.With regard to technical and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the works or services for which these capacities are required.With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies, become jointly and severally liable for the performance of the contract.If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be reexamined to identify the 8 best candidates. The only additional comparative criteria which will be taken into consideration during this re-examination, in the order that they appear below, are:1) The total number of reference projects found eligible under \"Technical capacity\" for each lot; and in case of equality on this criterion, then2) The value of the eligible part (the proportion carried out by the candidate participating either individually or in a grouping) of the projects found eligible under \"Technical capacity\" for each lotN.B.: additional comparative Criterion 2) will be applied only if the number of eligible candidates remain higher than 8 after applying additional comparative criterion 1).(1) Public Diplomacy refers to the “process whereby a country or an entity seeks to build trust and understanding by engaging with a broader foreign public beyond the governmental relations that, customarily, have been the focus of diplomatic effort\", Preparatory Action: \"Culture in EU External Relations\", European Parliament resolution of 12.5.2011 on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions.(2) http://intragate.ec.europa.eu/dg/devco/prag/annexes.do?annexName=A2a&lang=en notably annexes 7, 9 and 10(3) http://intragate.ec.europa.eu/dg/devco/prag/annexes.do?annexName=A2a&lang=en notably annexes 7, 9 and 10(4) http://intragate.ec.europa.eu/dg/devco/prag/annexes.do?annexName=A2a&lang=en notably annexes 7, 9 and 10\n",
